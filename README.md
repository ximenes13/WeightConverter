## 🚀 Features

🧮 Converts between kilograms and pounds (bidirectional) <br>
📥 Input field for entering any weight value <br>
🔘 Radio buttons to select conversion type: kgs ➡ lbs or lbs ➡ kgs <br>
🎯 "Convert" button to execute the calculation <br>
🧹 "Clear" button to reset the input and output fields <br>
📢 Displays formatted output with units (e.g., "72.60 lbs") <br>
❌ Error handling for invalid (non-numeric) input <br>
🪟 Clean and simple layout using Tkinter widgets <br>
🛠️ Easy to extend with more unit types or conversion logic <br>

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI interface)
- Math module (for π constant and scientific functions like sqrt, tan, cos, and sen)
- PyCharm (recommended IDE)

## 📂 Project Structure

- **main.py**: Main application script. Handles both UI layout and logic. Key responsibilities:

🖼️ Builds GUI layout using labels, entries, buttons, and radio buttons <br>

🔁 Uses `.config()` to dynamically update result text <br>

🧠 Performs conversion logic: kg → lbs and lbs → kg <br>

🧹 Includes a **Clear** button to reset both input and output <br>

❌ Handles `ValueError` when user input is not a number <br>

📏 Uses precise float conversion and formatting for output display <br>
